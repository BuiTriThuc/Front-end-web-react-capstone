        I feel like at home when I stay at Mingshus house. I like to chat with her lovely 7 year-
        old son. The location is very good: near grocery stores and bus stop (5min walk) and
        Cricklewood underground station (10min walk). The room is cozy and clean, my deluxe double
        room has a nice view. I had a pleasant stay in Greater London. I will book Mingshus house
        again if I travel to London next time. I feel like at home when I stay at Mingshus house. I
